# Machine-Learning-2019
This repository is created  for different ML topics, such as Graph ML, Bayesian ML, and ... for any one interested to learn these topics. 
Crrently you can find topic related to Bayesian ML and classification nd clustreing in this repo.
you can find related information and the list of content in each corresponding folder.

## List of projects:
**1. Bayesian Machine Learning:**(Gaussian Process regression, Bayesian optimization)
We start with a function and sample that at FOUR equally spaced points between its lower and upper bounds (the two bounds should be included in the four sampled points).
A. Then we use this sampled data to train a `Gaussian Process regression model`, by using `RBF kernel`.
Produce a figure which shows: (i) the four points sampled, (ii) the true function, (iii) the Gaussian Process regression prediction trained on the four sampled points, and (iv) the standard deviation s(x) in the prediction. 
B. Then we try to optimize the function using Bayesian optimization:
C. We will try a different acquisition function, called Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), to use within Bayesian optimization and to minimize the function. UCB is defined as:
           `𝑈𝐶𝐵(𝑥) = 𝑦)(𝑥) − 𝜅𝑠(𝑥)`
